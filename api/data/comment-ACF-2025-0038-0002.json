Tribes have their own human service programs, including Child Protection Services and do not need the additional oversight of another agency, such as the Children&rsquo;s Bureau (CB)/ACF to have to answer to for funding, especially as Sovereign Nations. In many ways this is no different than the State Department having oversight of federal funding provided to other Sovereign Nations (e.g., Ukraine, Israel, etc.).<br/><br/>The CB/ACF should only provide the allocation of funds and the oversight and monitoring of those funds and programs (i.e., title IV-B &amp; title IV-E) that are specific to States.<br/><br/>The oversight and monitoring of ICWA, specifically the States&rsquo; compliance, should NOT fall under BIA/DOI, as is in current federal regulations, or the CB/ACF for that matter, but rather under the appropriate legal system, as the State Courts hold much of the responsibility (i.e., transferring of cases to Tribal Court, etc.) within the requirements of ICWA.
