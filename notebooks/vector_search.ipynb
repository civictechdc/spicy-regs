As you are awsare, for more than fifty years, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) has given people the ability to comment upon federal projects that directly impact their communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;span style='padding-left: 30px'&gt;&lt;/span&gt;At this time, I very much urge you to please strengthen the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and undo the egregious damage caused by the Trump administration&amp;rsquo;s actions that put the interests of polluters over the health and well-being of our communities. For half a century, communities have used NEPA to have a say in what projects are built in their neighborhoods and voice concerns about the consequences federal projects and polluting industries create. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;span style='padding-left: 30px'&gt;&lt;/span&gt;I am writing in full support of the decision by the Biden administration to restore equity and certainty in federal decision-making under NEPA, This decision will protect the ability of the voices of communities fighting pollution who deserve a say in projects directly affecting their lives and livelihoods. I strongly urge the CEQ to please  reverse the changes that allowed polluting industries to prepare their own environmental reviews because this policy diminishes the role of alternative options to particular projects. Additionally, I very much urgr the CEQ to  please roll back the harmful provisions that silenced communities and prevented their participation in projects in their backyards.

       "      <td>Dear Council on Environmental Quality,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span style='padding-left: 30px'&gt;&lt;/span&gt;I am writing as a physician and public health advocate who strongly supports full protection for our environment. As you are awsare, for more than fifty years, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) has given people the ability to comment upon federal projects that directly impact their communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;span style='padding-left: 30px'&gt;&lt;/span&gt;At this time, I very much urge you to please strengthen the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and undo the egregious damage caused by the Trump administration&amp;rsquo;s actions that put the interests of polluters over the health and well-being of our communities. For half a century, communities have used NEPA to have a say in what projects are built in their neighborhoods and voice concerns about the consequences federal projects and polluting industries create. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;span style='padding-left: 30px'&gt;&lt;/span&gt;I am writing in full support of the decision by the Biden administration to restore equity and certainty in federal decision-making under NEPA, This decision will protect the ability of the voices of communities fighting pollution who deserve a say in projects directly affecting their lives and livelihoods. I strongly urge the CEQ to please  reverse the changes that allowed polluting industries to prepare their own environmental reviews because this policy diminishes the role of alternative options to particular projects. Additionally, I very much urgr the CEQ to  please roll back the harmful provisions that silenced communities and prevented their participation in projects in their backyards. I fully support CEQ&amp;rsquo;s efforts to restore the explicit requirement that agencies consider cumulative and indirect effects of projects that will ensure future decisions include the impacts of climate change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;span style='padding-left: 30px'&gt;&lt;/span&gt;At this time, I thgank you for your consideration of my letter.

Do lawmakers even recall the events that prompted the implementation of the regulations? Let me jog your memory:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cuyahoga River Fire(s). Yes, a river caught on fire. In fact it caught on fire 13 times due industrial pollution from 12 industrial plants upstream. Before NEPA, and before the cleanup, there was no plant life and no animal life in the river. It was toxic sludge. Clearly, corporate America cannot be trusted to protect our precious resources without the action-forcing oversight of NEPA. If that&amp;rsquo;s not enough to catch your attention, there&amp;rsquo;s the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, Avondale Mine disaster, Dust Bowl, Hawks Nest Tunnel disaster, Donora smog, brown lung disease, thermal pollution. And let&amp;rsquo;s not forget what&amp;rsquo;s happened since NEPA was enacted: Lake Peigneur, Three Mile Island, Tar Creek Superfund site, Exxon Valdez oil spill, Deepwater Horizon oil spill, Kleen Energy Systems power plant explosion, and the PEPCON disaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clearly corporate American cannot be trusted to regulate itself. If we want to have a country that&amp;rsquo;s livable, we need NEPA&amp;rsquo;s protections and we need more extensive environmental protections.</td>\n",

On December 14th, 2023, the US EPA Region 3, announced proposed new water quality standards to ensure essential protection for aquatic life in the Delaware Estuary. The proposal includes a recognition that estuary reaches of the river are used for fish propagation and must be protected as such. Significantly, the proposal includes new dissolved oxygen criteria to ensure enough oxygen in the water to support the aquatic life of the River, including the most oxygen sensitive species, of which Atlantic Sturgeon is the MOST sensitive.   \n",

       "4  Comment from Naples, Jean Dear Council on Environmental Quality,<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>I am writing as a physician and public health advocate who strongly supports full protection for our environment. As you are awsare, for more than fifty years, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) has given people the ability to comment upon federal projects that directly impact their communities. <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>At this time, I very much urge you to please strengthen the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and undo the egregious damage caused by the Trump administration&rsquo;s actions that put the interests of polluters over the health and well-being of our communities. For half a century, communities have used NEPA to have a say in what projects are built in their neighborhoods and voice concerns about the consequences federal projects and polluting industries create. <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>I am writing in full support of the decision by the Biden administration to restore equity and certainty in federal decision-making under NEPA, This decision will protect the ability of the voices of communities fighting pollution who deserve a say in projects directly affecting their lives and livelihoods. I strongly urge the CEQ to please  reverse the changes that allowed polluting industries to prepare their own environmental reviews because this policy diminishes the role of alternative options to particular projects. Additionally, I very much urgr the CEQ to  please roll back the harmful provisions that silenced communities and prevented their participation in projects in their backyards. I fully support CEQ&rsquo;s efforts to restore the explicit requirement that agencies consider cumulative and indirect effects of projects that will ensure future decisions include the impacts of climate change. <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>At this time, I thgank you for your consideration of my letter. It is very important to understand that communities of color are leading the fight against polluting industries, and  NEPA must continue to serve as a legal recourse that empowers them to fight for the ability foir their communitiedsto accerss clean air and clean water.  I am alerting you to the fact that as the Council on Environmental Qulaity, your agency has the opportunity to ensure NEPA will remain a critical tool that current and future generations can utilize to safeguard their communities. <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>To ensure full access to the the action of NEPA, I strongly urge you to please restore NEPA now!<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Jean Marie Naples, MD-Ph.D. <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Jean Naples<br/>26 Montebello Commons Dr  Suffern, NY 10901-4250   \n",

CEQ-2019-0003).<br/><br/>The proposed revisions are an unacceptable attack on the public&#39;s right<br/>to be informed of the environmental impacts of the federal government&#39;s<br/>actions and to hold the government accountable to protecting the<br/>environment.<br/><br/>The American public relies on the National Environmental Policy Act to<br/>ensure their communities are protected, their air is clean, their water<br/>pure, and their outdoors safeguarded.<br/><br/>The proposed rules would let the government off the hook when it comes<br/>to environmental disclosure and encourage less transparency.

The science is clear: the impacts of the federal hydroelectric dams, compounded by climate change, are accelerating the risk of extinction for salmon (and orcas that feed on them) by killing juvenile and adult salmon and steelhead and raising river temperatures well above lethal levels.   <br/><br/>The Biden administration must build off of the strong foundation laid by Senator Patty Murray, Governor Jay Inslee, Representative Mike Simpson and others. We urgently call for a comprehensive plan and action for Columbia Basin salmon restoration that:  <br/><br/>*Acknowledges the urgent need to recover abundant and healthy salmon populations as stated by the Columbia Basin Partnership and NOAA&rsquo;s Rebuilding Report and commits to an expedited timeline.    <br/><br/>*Clearly outlines a path that can lead to breaching the lower Snake River dams as soon as possible, provide fish passage into blocked areas, reintroduce salmon in the upper Columbia River, and fund  habitat restoration work throughout the Columbia River Basin.   <br/><br/>*Commits to immediate actions to replace the services the dams currently provide with salmon-friendly options (energy, transportation, irrigation). <br/><br/>*Commits to producing by Fall 2024 a supplemental EIS, BiOp and final decision to meet the Biden Administration&rsquo;s commitments and restore healthy, abundant salmon.   <br/><br/>*Upholds the federal government&rsquo;s legally-binding commitments to Northwest Tribal Nations and honors the promises made to them in treaties, trusts, and other responsibilities.  <br/><br/>We must act quickly and decisively, before Northwest salmon and steelhead are lost forever.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Georja Umano<br/>2222 6th St  Santa Monica, CA 90405-2486   \n",

Do lawmakers even recall the events that prompted the implementation of the regulations? Let me jog your memory:<br/><br/>The Cuyahoga River Fire(s). Yes, a river caught on fire. In fact it caught on fire 13 times due industrial pollution from 12 industrial plants upstream. Before NEPA, and before the cleanup, there was no plant life and no animal life in the river. It was toxic sludge. Clearly, corporate America cannot be trusted to protect our precious resources without the action-forcing oversight of NEPA. If that&rsquo;s not enough to catch your attention, there&rsquo;s the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, Avondale Mine disaster, Dust Bowl, Hawks Nest Tunnel disaster, Donora smog, brown lung disease, thermal pollution. And let&rsquo;s not forget what&rsquo;s happened since NEPA was enacted: Lake Peigneur, Three Mile Island, Tar Creek Superfund site, Exxon Valdez oil spill, Deepwater Horizon oil spill, Kleen Energy Systems power plant explosion, and the PEPCON disaster.<br/><br/>Clearly corporate American cannot be trusted to regulate itself. If we want to have a country that&rsquo;s livable, we need NEPA&rsquo;s protections and we need more extensive environmental protections.   \n",

On December 14th, 2023, the US EPA Region 3, announced proposed new water quality standards to ensure essential protection for aquatic life in the Delaware Estuary. The proposal includes a recognition that estuary reaches of the river are used for fish propagation and must be protected as such. Significantly, the proposal includes new dissolved oxygen criteria to ensure enough oxygen in the water to support the aquatic life of the River, including the most oxygen sensitive species, of which Atlantic Sturgeon is the MOST sensitive.    \n",

       "4  Dear Council on Environmental Quality,<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>I am writing as a physician and public health advocate who strongly supports full protection for our environment. As you are awsare, for more than fifty years, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) has given people the ability to comment upon federal projects that directly impact their communities. <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>At this time, I very much urge you to please strengthen the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and undo the egregious damage caused by the Trump administration&rsquo;s actions that put the interests of polluters over the health and well-being of our communities. For half a century, communities have used NEPA to have a say in what projects are built in their neighborhoods and voice concerns about the consequences federal projects and polluting industries create. <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>I am writing in full support of the decision by the Biden administration to restore equity and certainty in federal decision-making under NEPA, This decision will protect the ability of the voices of communities fighting pollution who deserve a say in projects directly affecting their lives and livelihoods. I strongly urge the CEQ to please  reverse the changes that allowed polluting industries to prepare their own environmental reviews because this policy diminishes the role of alternative options to particular projects. Additionally, I very much urgr the CEQ to  please roll back the harmful provisions that silenced communities and prevented their participation in projects in their backyards. I fully support CEQ&rsquo;s efforts to restore the explicit requirement that agencies consider cumulative and indirect effects of projects that will ensure future decisions include the impacts of climate change. <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>At this time, I thgank you for your consideration of my letter. It is very important to understand that communities of color are leading the fight against polluting industries, and  NEPA must continue to serve as a legal recourse that empowers them to fight for the ability foir their communitiedsto accerss clean air and clean water.  I am alerting you to the fact that as the Council on Environmental Qulaity, your agency has the opportunity to ensure NEPA will remain a critical tool that current and future generations can utilize to safeguard their communities. <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>To ensure full access to the the action of NEPA, I strongly urge you to please restore NEPA now!<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Jean Marie Naples, MD-Ph.D. <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Jean Naples<br/>26 Montebello Commons Dr  Suffern, NY 10901-4250   \n",

The science is clear: the impacts of the federal hydroelectric dams, compounded by climate change, are accelerating the risk of extinction for salmon (and orcas that feed on them) by killing juvenile and adult salmon and steelhead and raising river temperatures well above lethal levels.   <br/><br/>The Biden administration must build off of the strong foundation laid by Senator Patty Murray, Governor Jay Inslee, Representative Mike Simpson and others. We urgently call for a comprehensive plan and action for Columbia Basin salmon restoration that:  <br/><br/>*Acknowledges the urgent need to recover abundant and healthy salmon populations as stated by the Columbia Basin Partnership and NOAA&rsquo;s Rebuilding Report and commits to an expedited timeline.    <br/><br/>*Clearly outlines a path that can lead to breaching the lower Snake River dams as soon as possible, provide fish passage into blocked areas, reintroduce salmon in the upper Columbia River, and fund  habitat restoration work throughout the Columbia River Basin.   <br/><br/>*Commits to immediate actions to replace the services the dams currently provide with salmon-friendly options (energy, transportation, irrigation). <br/><br/>*Commits to producing by Fall 2024 a supplemental EIS, BiOp and final decision to meet the Biden Administration&rsquo;s commitments and restore healthy, abundant salmon.   <br/><br/>*Upholds the federal government&rsquo;s legally-binding commitments to Northwest Tribal Nations and honors the promises made to them in treaties, trusts, and other responsibilities.  <br/><br/>We must act quickly and decisively, before Northwest salmon and steelhead are lost forever.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Georja Umano<br/>2222 6th St  Santa Monica, CA 90405-2486   \n",

Do lawmakers even recall the events that prompted the implementation of the regulations? Let me jog your memory:<br/><br/>The Cuyahoga River Fire(s). Yes, a river caught on fire. In fact it caught on fire 13 times due industrial pollution from 12 industrial plants upstream. Before NEPA, and before the cleanup, there was no plant life and no animal life in the river. It was toxic sludge. Clearly, corporate America cannot be trusted to protect our precious resources without the action-forcing oversight of NEPA. If that&rsquo;s not enough to catch your attention, there&rsquo;s the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, Avondale Mine disaster, Dust Bowl, Hawks Nest Tunnel disaster, Donora smog, brown lung disease, thermal pollution. And let&rsquo;s not forget what&rsquo;s happened since NEPA was enacted: Lake Peigneur, Three Mile Island, Tar Creek Superfund site, Exxon Valdez oil spill, Deepwater Horizon oil spill, Kleen Energy Systems power plant explosion, and the PEPCON disaster.<br/><br/>Clearly corporate American cannot be trusted to regulate itself. If we want to have a country that&rsquo;s livable, we need NEPA&rsquo;s protections and we need more extensive environmental protections.   \n",

Plastic is polluting everything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I applaud the EPA&amp;#39;s Draft National Strategy to Prevent Plastic Pollution for asserting that the practice of converting plastic waste to fuel or fuel substitutes is not &amp;quot;recycling.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, I urge the agency to significantly strengthen the proposals on reducing plastic waste, especially from single-use plastics, at the source.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given that less than 10% of all plastic ever made has actually been recycled, it&amp;#39;s clear we need to stop producing so much wasteful plastic in the first place. In order to truly address our country&amp;#39;s plastic pollution crisis, it&amp;#39;s crucial that the Draft National Strategy to Prevent Plastic Pollution include strong, concrete policies to ensure that fewer single-use items are produced in the first place, and to make plastic producers responsible for reducing their plastic footprint.</td>\n",

Chemical fertilizers&amp;mdash;those granular, powdered, or liquid products identified by NPK (the percentages of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium)&amp;mdash;consist of highly-soluble chemical salts that feed plants directly, but poison soil microorganisms. The choice of such fertilizers rules out an organic system in which fertility inputs feed organisms in the soil, which release substances that feed plants. Chemical fertilizers also contribute to climate change because they are produced with fossil fuels and limit the ability of soil to draw down (sequester) atmospheric carbon, thus undermining efforts to mitigate the climate emergency and the horrific fire and flooding events that destroy life. Chemical fertilizers, in addition, produce weak growth that invites insects to feed on the plants. Aphids, for example, have long been known to increase on plants fertilized with soluble nitrogen fertilizer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EPA encourages the land application of biosolids (sewage sludge), noting benefits to soil fertility and structure and other &amp;ldquo;economic and waste management benefits (e.g., conservation of landfill space; reduced demand on nonrenewable resources like phosphorus; and a reduced demand for synthetic fertilizers).&amp;rdquo; However, as summarized by the Guardian, &amp;ldquo;Now the practice is behind a growing number of public health problems. Spreading pollutant-filled biosolids on farmland is making people sick, contaminating drinking water and filling crops, livestock, and humans with everything from pharmaceuticals to PFAS.&amp;rdquo; Biosolids used as fertilizer also contribute plastic to the soil. Unfortunately, many products derived from biosolids are sold as &amp;ldquo;organic&amp;rdquo; fertilizers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wise gardener or farmer chooses soil amendments that are not toxic to the soil, environment, or consumers. One way to ensure freedom from chemical fertilizers or biosolids is to look for the OMRI (Organic Materials Review Institute) seal. Organic standards specifically prohibit the use of sewage sludge (aka biosolids), but the home gardener may not always be able to discern the materials from which &amp;ldquo;organic&amp;rdquo; fertilizers are made. In addition, &amp;ldquo;organic&amp;rdquo; fertilizers sourced from composted manure generally come from nonorganic confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs) and may also contain undesirable contaminants such as antibiotics, antibiotic resistance genes, pesticide degradants, or heavy metals. Since these contaminants are not regulated, Safer Choice could offer an additional indicator of safety for gardeners and farmers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please add the category of fertilizers or soil amendments to Safer Choice. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thank you.</td>\n",

EPA took an important step toward addressing the problem in your recent proposal, but we urge you to strengthen the level of protection in the final standards.<br/><br/>I am writing to express my support for stronger science-based standards  soot emissions reaching levels no higher than 8 micrograms per cubic meter annually, and 25 micrograms per cubic meter daily  to ensure cleaner air for everyone. Strengthening our current annual national soot standard of 12 micrograms per cubic meter to 8 micrograms per cubic meter would save 16,000 lives each year.<br/><br/>Exposure to, and inhalation of, soot is linked to a variety of heart and lung diseases, in addition to reduced lung development in children, higher rates of asthma, bronchitis, heart disease, cancer and early death.<br/><br/>Updating these decade old standards consistent with the health science will help protect our most vulnerable, including children, seniors and people with chronic illness. These groups are particularly susceptible to the impacts of soot inhalation and are more likely to suffer increased mortality rates, hospitalizations and visits to the ER.<br/><br/>Impacts like these are particularly felt in communities of color and low-income communities, who are more likely to live in areas co-located with sources of this deadly pollutant. But stronger federal standards could change this, shrinking disparities and ensuring cleaner air for everyone. <br/><br/>Please finalize the strongest possible soot standards soon. There is no time to waste.<br/><br/>Shalom,<br/><br/>I am a servant of Lord Yahweh(God) Almighty and the Most High Yahweh in heaven, Lord Jesus Christ who is Lord Yahwehs son and the Messiah or the Anointed One and the Holy Spirit.  I have been given the authority to speak on their behalf.  Lord Yahweh already knows about this issue.  Lord Yahweh is waiting on his children to finally do something about this issue.  Every day millions of Americans inhale air pollution from burning fossil fuels. This air pollution includes fine particle pollution  a dangerous emission more commonly known as soot.

Rocky Mountain Powers Hunter and Huntington coal plants emit unacceptable levels of haze-causing air pollution and they must be cleaned up. <br/><br/>These outdated coal plants have muddied scenic views, harmed our lungs and obstructed clear night skies for far too long in Utahs Arches, Canyonlands, Bryce Canyon, Capitol Reef, and Zion National Parks -- as well as others in the Southwest such as Grand Canyon, Mesa Verde and Black Canyon of the Gunnison. <br/><br/>EPA must require these haze polluters to clean up once and for all. We had a plan in place since 2016 that would have done just that and I urge EPA to disapprove this SIP revision and instead continue to require significant reductions in nitrogen oxides and particulate matter from Hunter and Huntington. <br/><br/>Our parks, our local economies that depend on clean, healthy parks for tourism, and the people who travel from across the world to visit them deserve better than this plan. <br/><br/>Regards, <br/>Marti Cooksey   \n",

Now, It&rsquo;s almost impossible to come back from the store without plastic, even though it&rsquo;s clear we should be able to do it. Plastic is polluting everything.<br/><br/>I applaud the EPA&#39;s Draft National Strategy to Prevent Plastic Pollution for asserting that the practice of converting plastic waste to fuel or fuel substitutes is not &quot;recycling.&quot;<br/><br/>However, I urge the agency to significantly strengthen the proposals on reducing plastic waste, especially from single-use plastics, at the source.<br/><br/>Given that less than 10% of all plastic ever made has actually been recycled, it&#39;s clear we need to stop producing so much wasteful plastic in the first place. In order to truly address our country&#39;s plastic pollution crisis, it&#39;s crucial that the Draft National Strategy to Prevent Plastic Pollution include strong, concrete policies to ensure that fewer single-use items are produced in the first place, and to make plastic producers responsible for reducing their plastic footprint.   \n",

On December 14th, 2023, the US EPA Region 3, announced proposed new water quality standards to ensure essential protection for aquatic life in the Delaware Estuary. The proposal includes a recognition that estuary reaches of the river are used for fish propagation and must be protected as such. Significantly, the proposal includes new dissolved oxygen criteria to ensure enough oxygen in the water to support the aquatic life of the River, including the most oxygen sensitive species, of which Atlantic Sturgeon is the MOST sensitive.   \n",

       "7  Comment submitted by Debbie Blair As EPA considers expanding the Safer Choice program, I request that it add the category of fertilizers or soil amendments.  <br/><br/>Sometimes the choice of material drives the choice of system&mdash;as is the case for soil amendments. Chemical fertilizers&mdash;those granular, powdered, or liquid products identified by NPK (the percentages of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium)&mdash;consist of highly-soluble chemical salts that feed plants directly, but poison soil microorganisms. The choice of such fertilizers rules out an organic system in which fertility inputs feed organisms in the soil, which release substances that feed plants. Chemical fertilizers also contribute to climate change because they are produced with fossil fuels and limit the ability of soil to draw down (sequester) atmospheric carbon, thus undermining efforts to mitigate the climate emergency and the horrific fire and flooding events that destroy life. Chemical fertilizers, in addition, produce weak growth that invites insects to feed on the plants. Aphids, for example, have long been known to increase on plants fertilized with soluble nitrogen fertilizer. <br/><br/>EPA encourages the land application of biosolids (sewage sludge), noting benefits to soil fertility and structure and other &ldquo;economic and waste management benefits (e.g., conservation of landfill space; reduced demand on nonrenewable resources like phosphorus; and a reduced demand for synthetic fertilizers).&rdquo; However, as summarized by the Guardian, &ldquo;Now the practice is behind a growing number of public health problems. Spreading pollutant-filled biosolids on farmland is making people sick, contaminating drinking water and filling crops, livestock, and humans with everything from pharmaceuticals to PFAS.&rdquo; Biosolids used as fertilizer also contribute plastic to the soil. Unfortunately, many products derived from biosolids are sold as &ldquo;organic&rdquo; fertilizers. <br/><br/>The wise gardener or farmer chooses soil amendments that are not toxic to the soil, environment, or consumers. One way to ensure freedom from chemical fertilizers or biosolids is to look for the OMRI (Organic Materials Review Institute) seal. Organic standards specifically prohibit the use of sewage sludge (aka biosolids), but the home gardener may not always be able to discern the materials from which &ldquo;organic&rdquo; fertilizers are made. In addition, &ldquo;organic&rdquo; fertilizers sourced from composted manure generally come from nonorganic confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs) and may also contain undesirable contaminants such as antibiotics, antibiotic resistance genes, pesticide degradants, or heavy metals. Since these contaminants are not regulated, Safer Choice could offer an additional indicator of safety for gardeners and farmers. <br/><br/>Please add the category of fertilizers or soil amendments to Safer Choice. <br/><br/>Thank you.   \n",

My region is characterized by a long growing season and sufficient rainfall that makes good weed control a critical necessity for producing a crop.<br/> <br/>Herbicide-resistant weeds are a serious problem in my area and dicamba is an important tool that I use to control resistant weeds on my farm.  Dicamba used in combination with other products that have different modes of action is the recommended practice for managing herbicide resistant weeds.<br/> <br/>I urge EPA to approve KHNP0090 Herbicide for the 2025 crop season so that my farm can have access to this important weed management tool.   \n",

EPA took an important step toward addressing the problem in your recent proposal, but we urge you to strengthen the level of protection in the final standards.<br/><br/>I am writing to express my support for stronger science-based standards  soot emissions reaching levels no higher than 8 micrograms per cubic meter annually, and 25 micrograms per cubic meter daily  to ensure cleaner air for everyone. Strengthening our current annual national soot standard of 12 micrograms per cubic meter to 8 micrograms per cubic meter would save 16,000 lives each year.<br/><br/>Exposure to, and inhalation of, soot is linked to a variety of heart and lung diseases, in addition to reduced lung development in children, higher rates of asthma, bronchitis, heart disease, cancer and early death.<br/><br/>Updating these decade old standards consistent with the health science will help protect our most vulnerable, including children, seniors and people with chronic illness. These groups are particularly susceptible to the impacts of soot inhalation and are more likely to suffer increased mortality rates, hospitalizations and visits to the ER.<br/><br/>Impacts like these are particularly felt in communities of color and low-income communities, who are more likely to live in areas co-located with sources of this deadly pollutant. But stronger federal standards could change this, shrinking disparities and ensuring cleaner air for everyone. <br/><br/>Please finalize the strongest possible soot standards soon. There is no time to waste.<br/><br/>Shalom,<br/><br/>I am a servant of Lord Yahweh(God) Almighty and the Most High Yahweh in heaven, Lord Jesus Christ who is Lord Yahwehs son and the Messiah or the Anointed One and the Holy Spirit.  I have been given the authority to speak on their behalf.  Lord Yahweh already knows about this issue.  Lord Yahweh is waiting on his children to finally do something about this issue.  Every day millions of Americans inhale air pollution from burning fossil fuels. This air pollution includes fine particle pollution  a dangerous emission more commonly known as soot.

Rocky Mountain Powers Hunter and Huntington coal plants emit unacceptable levels of haze-causing air pollution and they must be cleaned up. <br/><br/>These outdated coal plants have muddied scenic views, harmed our lungs and obstructed clear night skies for far too long in Utahs Arches, Canyonlands, Bryce Canyon, Capitol Reef, and Zion National Parks -- as well as others in the Southwest such as Grand Canyon, Mesa Verde and Black Canyon of the Gunnison. <br/><br/>EPA must require these haze polluters to clean up once and for all. We had a plan in place since 2016 that would have done just that and I urge EPA to disapprove this SIP revision and instead continue to require significant reductions in nitrogen oxides and particulate matter from Hunter and Huntington. <br/><br/>Our parks, our local economies that depend on clean, healthy parks for tourism, and the people who travel from across the world to visit them deserve better than this plan. <br/><br/>Regards, <br/>Marti Cooksey   \n",

Now, It&rsquo;s almost impossible to come back from the store without plastic, even though it&rsquo;s clear we should be able to do it. Plastic is polluting everything.<br/><br/>I applaud the EPA&#39;s Draft National Strategy to Prevent Plastic Pollution for asserting that the practice of converting plastic waste to fuel or fuel substitutes is not &quot;recycling.&quot;<br/><br/>However, I urge the agency to significantly strengthen the proposals on reducing plastic waste, especially from single-use plastics, at the source.<br/><br/>Given that less than 10% of all plastic ever made has actually been recycled, it&#39;s clear we need to stop producing so much wasteful plastic in the first place. In order to truly address our country&#39;s plastic pollution crisis, it&#39;s crucial that the Draft National Strategy to Prevent Plastic Pollution include strong, concrete policies to ensure that fewer single-use items are produced in the first place, and to make plastic producers responsible for reducing their plastic footprint.   \n",

On December 14th, 2023, the US EPA Region 3, announced proposed new water quality standards to ensure essential protection for aquatic life in the Delaware Estuary. The proposal includes a recognition that estuary reaches of the river are used for fish propagation and must be protected as such. Significantly, the proposal includes new dissolved oxygen criteria to ensure enough oxygen in the water to support the aquatic life of the River, including the most oxygen sensitive species, of which Atlantic Sturgeon is the MOST sensitive.    \n",

       "7  As EPA considers expanding the Safer Choice program, I request that it add the category of fertilizers or soil amendments.  <br/><br/>Sometimes the choice of material drives the choice of system&mdash;as is the case for soil amendments. Chemical fertilizers&mdash;those granular, powdered, or liquid products identified by NPK (the percentages of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium)&mdash;consist of highly-soluble chemical salts that feed plants directly, but poison soil microorganisms. The choice of such fertilizers rules out an organic system in which fertility inputs feed organisms in the soil, which release substances that feed plants. Chemical fertilizers also contribute to climate change because they are produced with fossil fuels and limit the ability of soil to draw down (sequester) atmospheric carbon, thus undermining efforts to mitigate the climate emergency and the horrific fire and flooding events that destroy life. Chemical fertilizers, in addition, produce weak growth that invites insects to feed on the plants. Aphids, for example, have long been known to increase on plants fertilized with soluble nitrogen fertilizer. <br/><br/>EPA encourages the land application of biosolids (sewage sludge), noting benefits to soil fertility and structure and other &ldquo;economic and waste management benefits (e.g., conservation of landfill space; reduced demand on nonrenewable resources like phosphorus; and a reduced demand for synthetic fertilizers).&rdquo; However, as summarized by the Guardian, &ldquo;Now the practice is behind a growing number of public health problems. Spreading pollutant-filled biosolids on farmland is making people sick, contaminating drinking water and filling crops, livestock, and humans with everything from pharmaceuticals to PFAS.&rdquo; Biosolids used as fertilizer also contribute plastic to the soil. Unfortunately, many products derived from biosolids are sold as &ldquo;organic&rdquo; fertilizers. <br/><br/>The wise gardener or farmer chooses soil amendments that are not toxic to the soil, environment, or consumers. One way to ensure freedom from chemical fertilizers or biosolids is to look for the OMRI (Organic Materials Review Institute) seal. Organic standards specifically prohibit the use of sewage sludge (aka biosolids), but the home gardener may not always be able to discern the materials from which &ldquo;organic&rdquo; fertilizers are made. In addition, &ldquo;organic&rdquo; fertilizers sourced from composted manure generally come from nonorganic confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs) and may also contain undesirable contaminants such as antibiotics, antibiotic resistance genes, pesticide degradants, or heavy metals. Since these contaminants are not regulated, Safer Choice could offer an additional indicator of safety for gardeners and farmers. <br/><br/>Please add the category of fertilizers or soil amendments to Safer Choice. <br/><br/>Thank you.    \n",

My region is characterized by a long growing season and sufficient rainfall that makes good weed control a critical necessity for producing a crop.<br/> <br/>Herbicide-resistant weeds are a serious problem in my area and dicamba is an important tool that I use to control resistant weeds on my farm.  Dicamba used in combination with other products that have different modes of action is the recommended practice for managing herbicide resistant weeds.<br/> <br/>I urge EPA to approve KHNP0090 Herbicide for the 2025 crop season so that my farm can have access to this important weed management tool.   \n",

In addition, &amp;ldquo;organic&amp;rdquo; fertilizers sourced from composted manure generally come from nonorganic confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs) and may also contain undesirable contaminants such as antibiotics, antibiotic resistance genes, pesticide degradants, or heavy metals. Since these contaminants are not regulated, Safer Choice could offer an additional indicator of safety for gardeners and farmers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please add the category of fertilizers or soil amendments to Safer Choice. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thank you.</td>\n",

Beyond these outdoor experiences, these protections are critically important in the face of a changing climate and changing demands on our public lands. These ecosystems help support all life on Earth, from clean drinking water to habitat for endangered wildlife.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Please keep the Roadless Rule in place and help save these beloved forests. Millions of Americans have supported the Roadless Rule since its creation, and I join them in urging you to protect our legacy of public lands.</td>\n",

       "0  Comment submitted by Debbie Blair As EPA considers expanding the Safer Choice program, I request that it add the category of fertilizers or soil amendments.  <br/><br/>Sometimes the choice of material drives the choice of system&mdash;as is the case for soil amendments. Chemical fertilizers&mdash;those granular, powdered, or liquid products identified by NPK (the percentages of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium)&mdash;consist of highly-soluble chemical salts that feed plants directly, but poison soil microorganisms. The choice of such fertilizers rules out an organic system in which fertility inputs feed organisms in the soil, which release substances that feed plants. Chemical fertilizers also contribute to climate change because they are produced with fossil fuels and limit the ability of soil to draw down (sequester) atmospheric carbon, thus undermining efforts to mitigate the climate emergency and the horrific fire and flooding events that destroy life. Chemical fertilizers, in addition, produce weak growth that invites insects to feed on the plants. Aphids, for example, have long been known to increase on plants fertilized with soluble nitrogen fertilizer. <br/><br/>EPA encourages the land application of biosolids (sewage sludge), noting benefits to soil fertility and structure and other &ldquo;economic and waste management benefits (e.g., conservation of landfill space; reduced demand on nonrenewable resources like phosphorus; and a reduced demand for synthetic fertilizers).&rdquo; However, as summarized by the Guardian, &ldquo;Now the practice is behind a growing number of public health problems. Spreading pollutant-filled biosolids on farmland is making people sick, contaminating drinking water and filling crops, livestock, and humans with everything from pharmaceuticals to PFAS.&rdquo; Biosolids used as fertilizer also contribute plastic to the soil. Unfortunately, many products derived from biosolids are sold as &ldquo;organic&rdquo; fertilizers. <br/><br/>The wise gardener or farmer chooses soil amendments that are not toxic to the soil, environment, or consumers. One way to ensure freedom from chemical fertilizers or biosolids is to look for the OMRI (Organic Materials Review Institute) seal. Organic standards specifically prohibit the use of sewage sludge (aka biosolids), but the home gardener may not always be able to discern the materials from which &ldquo;organic&rdquo; fertilizers are made. In addition, &ldquo;organic&rdquo; fertilizers sourced from composted manure generally come from nonorganic confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs) and may also contain undesirable contaminants such as antibiotics, antibiotic resistance genes, pesticide degradants, or heavy metals. Since these contaminants are not regulated, Safer Choice could offer an additional indicator of safety for gardeners and farmers. <br/><br/>Please add the category of fertilizers or soil amendments to Safer Choice. <br/><br/>Thank you.   \n",

I regularly purchase Organic products because I want to avoid exposure to harmful pesticides and chemicals. I expect that the certified Organic food and non-food products I buy are free of harmful substances. I also expect those foods and products to be produced in ways that do not pollute or harm animals and the environment.<br/><br/>There is ever-growing evidence of the harm caused by PFAS chemicals. This class of toxic chemicals should be banned in Organic production. I should be able to expect that the Organic foods and consumer products I buy do not contain any of these dangerous chemicals.<br/><br/>The overuse of plastics in Organic farming and retail is very problematic and alternatives need to be developed quickly. Research shows plastic chemicals, including PFAS, BPA, phthalates and other endocrine-disrupting chemicals can leach into food from plastic containers and packaging. Additionally, plastics break down into toxic microplastics, which we also then consume.<br/><br/>I am urging the NOSB to implement the following:<br/>1. Place the entire class of PFAS chemicals on the National List of Prohibited Substances in Organic production, including Teflon and PTFE-coated equipment, lubricants, and cleaners in organic food prep and processing.<br/>2. For Organic compost, strengthen the rules to prevent toxic chemicals, synthetic pesticides and GMO contamination.<br/>3. Phase out the use of plastic mulch and tarps for growing.<br/>4. Phase out the use of fluorinated (PFAS-coated) HDPE plastic containers and packaging.<br/>5. Phase out the use of all petrochemical-based plastic containers and packaging for retail.<br/>6. Require a separate certification label for hydroponics.<br/>7. Prohibit polluting CAFOs (Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations, also known as factory farms) from being certified Organic.<br/><br/>The Organic sector has a duty to exclude harmful substances, materials and practices whenever sufficient evidence arises to prove harm. There is more than enough scientific evidence to show that PFAS chemicals and microplastics do not belong in Organic food and products. Integrity is critically important. I want to be confident when I recommend Organics to my friends and family. <br/><br/>Implementing the above actions would help Organic shoppers like me to reduce my exposure to those dangerous toxins. Implementing these actions would bring the National Organic Program closer to what shoppers expect and are paying a premium for.<br/><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>The relevant research can be found here: https://toxinfreeusa.org/organic-concerns-everyone-should-be-talking-about-on-earth-day   \n",

The promotion of water is of high importance.<br/>Added sugars are contributing to an obesity crisis among our youngest children. More than four in 10 (45%) white children have had a sugary drink by age 2 and nearly three in four (74%) Latino children have, according to a Salud America! research review (http://salud.to/sugarresearch). Additionally, nearly 60% of infant and toddler food and drink advertising dollars promoted products not recommended for young children, including sugar-sweetened toddler milk (https://salud.to/babyfoodmarket). Nearly 2 of 3 U.S. children&#39;s drinks sold in 2018 were unhealthy fruit drinks and flavored waters with added sugars and/or diet sweeteners (https://salud.to/childrens-drinks). I support the independent Advisory Committee&#39;s scientific report on July 15, 2020, that suggests added sugars should be limited to 6% of a person&#39;s daily calories (down from 10%), and no sugary drinks for children up to age 2. I would also urge the promotion of water as the drink of choice, especially on the MyPlate and MiPlato graphics. Do not weaken these recommendations at the request of the sugary drink industry. Make a stand for healthy children starting at the earliest ages.   \n",

I would like you to act on these three critical areas that require attention:<br/><br/>Maintaining Compost Purity in Organic Production<br/><br/>I strongly oppose allowing contaminated compost in organic production. Compost is fundamentally an end product of natural biological processes, and only materials consisting entirely of nonsynthetic feedstocks should be permitted in organic crop production. Allowing compost contaminated with synthetic materials, inks, or other non-organic substances undermines the integrity of organic standards and potentially introduces harmful compounds into what consumers expect to be pure organic systems. The current standard recognizing compost as a natural product should be maintained and strengthened by explicitly prohibiting contaminated inputs.<br/><br/>Comprehensive Assessment of &quot;Inert&quot; Ingredients<br/><br/>I urge the thorough evaluation of so-called &quot;inert&quot; ingredients when approving pest control methods for organic production. These substances, defined as any ingredient other than the active ingredient intentionally included in a pesticide product, can have significant environmental and health impacts despite their misleading &quot;inert&quot; designation. A truly organic approach must consider the full formulation of pest control products, not just their active components. The cumulative effects of these ingredients may compromise organic integrity and consumer trust in organic certification.<br/><br/>Expanded Research Priorities for Organic Production<br/><br/>I strongly recommend expanding organic research priorities to include comprehensive investigations into chemicals such as PFAS, orthophthalates, and bisphenols that frequently appear as food contact substances. These persistent compounds pose significant health and environmental concerns that may undermine organic principles. Additionally, I urge you to establish rigorous assessment protocols for microbes used in fermentation processes to ensure they are not genetically engineered (GE). Such verification is essential to maintaining the foundational principles of organic production and addressing emerging concerns about contamination pathways in organic systems.<br/><br/>Thank you for your attention to these critical issues that will serve to strengthen the organic standard.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Julie Morgan<br/>Kansas City, MO   \n",

Corson Regarding Clopyralid, This is a highly toxic and contaminating substance that effects 2nd, 3rd, 4th...hand users through the food chain, maybe more.  This pesticide needs to be banned.  There is no way to regulate a chemical with such deleterious effects to run off contaminated water, fields that the run off or overspray hits, or compost that ends up in peoples gardens (both organic and non-organic) killing their food sources and potentially harming their health.  Composters fairly know if the manure they are recieving has been contaminated from livestock that have eaten grass or other vegetation that has been sprayed or contaminated.  The EPA and DOW should be held liable for all damages, but rarely do people ever know or are able to track it back to the source.  This is a intrusion on peoples rights.   Please ban this substance.   \n",

The Roadless Area Conservation Rule protects over 58 million acres of some of the wildest forests we have left, forests that protect critical wildlife habitat and drinking water for millions. Revoking the Roadless Rule puts landscapes, wildlife, and communities at risk. <br/><br/>Repealing this popular policy would devastate the wild places that bring us together and damage the fast-growing outdoor recreation industry that supports countless communities.

As an outdoors enthusiast, I cherish our country&#39;s public lands and waters, including the millions of acres of wild and roadless forests.<br/> <br/>Rescinding the Roadless Rule threatens landscapes that include some of the most iconic and well-loved places for climbing, fishing, hiking, backcountry skiing, mountain biking and paddling, as well as the economic value of recreation in many rural communities. Beyond these outdoor experiences, these protections are critically important in the face of a changing climate and changing demands on our public lands. These ecosystems help support all life on Earth, from clean drinking water to habitat for endangered wildlife.<br/> <br/>Please keep the Roadless Rule in place and help save these beloved forests. Millions of Americans have supported the Roadless Rule since its creation, and I join them in urging you to protect our legacy of public lands.   \n",

       "0  As EPA considers expanding the Safer Choice program, I request that it add the category of fertilizers or soil amendments.  <br/><br/>Sometimes the choice of material drives the choice of system&mdash;as is the case for soil amendments. Chemical fertilizers&mdash;those granular, powdered, or liquid products identified by NPK (the percentages of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium)&mdash;consist of highly-soluble chemical salts that feed plants directly, but poison soil microorganisms. The choice of such fertilizers rules out an organic system in which fertility inputs feed organisms in the soil, which release substances that feed plants. Chemical fertilizers also contribute to climate change because they are produced with fossil fuels and limit the ability of soil to draw down (sequester) atmospheric carbon, thus undermining efforts to mitigate the climate emergency and the horrific fire and flooding events that destroy life. Chemical fertilizers, in addition, produce weak growth that invites insects to feed on the plants. Aphids, for example, have long been known to increase on plants fertilized with soluble nitrogen fertilizer. <br/><br/>EPA encourages the land application of biosolids (sewage sludge), noting benefits to soil fertility and structure and other &ldquo;economic and waste management benefits (e.g., conservation of landfill space; reduced demand on nonrenewable resources like phosphorus; and a reduced demand for synthetic fertilizers).&rdquo; However, as summarized by the Guardian, &ldquo;Now the practice is behind a growing number of public health problems. Spreading pollutant-filled biosolids on farmland is making people sick, contaminating drinking water and filling crops, livestock, and humans with everything from pharmaceuticals to PFAS.&rdquo; Biosolids used as fertilizer also contribute plastic to the soil. Unfortunately, many products derived from biosolids are sold as &ldquo;organic&rdquo; fertilizers. <br/><br/>The wise gardener or farmer chooses soil amendments that are not toxic to the soil, environment, or consumers. One way to ensure freedom from chemical fertilizers or biosolids is to look for the OMRI (Organic Materials Review Institute) seal. Organic standards specifically prohibit the use of sewage sludge (aka biosolids), but the home gardener may not always be able to discern the materials from which &ldquo;organic&rdquo; fertilizers are made. In addition, &ldquo;organic&rdquo; fertilizers sourced from composted manure generally come from nonorganic confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs) and may also contain undesirable contaminants such as antibiotics, antibiotic resistance genes, pesticide degradants, or heavy metals. Since these contaminants are not regulated, Safer Choice could offer an additional indicator of safety for gardeners and farmers. <br/><br/>Please add the category of fertilizers or soil amendments to Safer Choice. <br/><br/>Thank you.    \n",

I regularly purchase Organic products because I want to avoid exposure to harmful pesticides and chemicals. I expect that the certified Organic food and non-food products I buy are free of harmful substances. I also expect those foods and products to be produced in ways that do not pollute or harm animals and the environment.<br/><br/>There is ever-growing evidence of the harm caused by PFAS chemicals. This class of toxic chemicals should be banned in Organic production. I should be able to expect that the Organic foods and consumer products I buy do not contain any of these dangerous chemicals.<br/><br/>The overuse of plastics in Organic farming and retail is very problematic and alternatives need to be developed quickly. Research shows plastic chemicals, including PFAS, BPA, phthalates and other endocrine-disrupting chemicals can leach into food from plastic containers and packaging. Additionally, plastics break down into toxic microplastics, which we also then consume.<br/><br/>I am urging the NOSB to implement the following:<br/>1. Place the entire class of PFAS chemicals on the National List of Prohibited Substances in Organic production, including Teflon and PTFE-coated equipment, lubricants, and cleaners in organic food prep and processing.<br/>2. For Organic compost, strengthen the rules to prevent toxic chemicals, synthetic pesticides and GMO contamination.<br/>3. Phase out the use of plastic mulch and tarps for growing.<br/>4. Phase out the use of fluorinated (PFAS-coated) HDPE plastic containers and packaging.<br/>5. Phase out the use of all petrochemical-based plastic containers and packaging for retail.<br/>6. Require a separate certification label for hydroponics.<br/>7. Prohibit polluting CAFOs (Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations, also known as factory farms) from being certified Organic.<br/><br/>The Organic sector has a duty to exclude harmful substances, materials and practices whenever sufficient evidence arises to prove harm. There is more than enough scientific evidence to show that PFAS chemicals and microplastics do not belong in Organic food and products. Integrity is critically important. I want to be confident when I recommend Organics to my friends and family. <br/><br/>Implementing the above actions would help Organic shoppers like me to reduce my exposure to those dangerous toxins. Implementing these actions would bring the National Organic Program closer to what shoppers expect and are paying a premium for.<br/><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>The relevant research can be found here: https://toxinfreeusa.org/organic-concerns-everyone-should-be-talking-about-on-earth-day   \n",

The promotion of water is of high importance.<br/>Added sugars are contributing to an obesity crisis among our youngest children. More than four in 10 (45%) white children have had a sugary drink by age 2 and nearly three in four (74%) Latino children have, according to a Salud America! research review (http://salud.to/sugarresearch). Additionally, nearly 60% of infant and toddler food and drink advertising dollars promoted products not recommended for young children, including sugar-sweetened toddler milk (https://salud.to/babyfoodmarket). Nearly 2 of 3 U.S. children&#39;s drinks sold in 2018 were unhealthy fruit drinks and flavored waters with added sugars and/or diet sweeteners (https://salud.to/childrens-drinks). I support the independent Advisory Committee&#39;s scientific report on July 15, 2020, that suggests added sugars should be limited to 6% of a person&#39;s daily calories (down from 10%), and no sugary drinks for children up to age 2. I would also urge the promotion of water as the drink of choice, especially on the MyPlate and MiPlato graphics. Do not weaken these recommendations at the request of the sugary drink industry. Make a stand for healthy children starting at the earliest ages.   \n",

I would like you to act on these three critical areas that require attention:<br/><br/>Maintaining Compost Purity in Organic Production<br/><br/>I strongly oppose allowing contaminated compost in organic production. Compost is fundamentally an end product of natural biological processes, and only materials consisting entirely of nonsynthetic feedstocks should be permitted in organic crop production. Allowing compost contaminated with synthetic materials, inks, or other non-organic substances undermines the integrity of organic standards and potentially introduces harmful compounds into what consumers expect to be pure organic systems. The current standard recognizing compost as a natural product should be maintained and strengthened by explicitly prohibiting contaminated inputs.<br/><br/>Comprehensive Assessment of &quot;Inert&quot; Ingredients<br/><br/>I urge the thorough evaluation of so-called &quot;inert&quot; ingredients when approving pest control methods for organic production. These substances, defined as any ingredient other than the active ingredient intentionally included in a pesticide product, can have significant environmental and health impacts despite their misleading &quot;inert&quot; designation. A truly organic approach must consider the full formulation of pest control products, not just their active components. The cumulative effects of these ingredients may compromise organic integrity and consumer trust in organic certification.<br/><br/>Expanded Research Priorities for Organic Production<br/><br/>I strongly recommend expanding organic research priorities to include comprehensive investigations into chemicals such as PFAS, orthophthalates, and bisphenols that frequently appear as food contact substances. These persistent compounds pose significant health and environmental concerns that may undermine organic principles. Additionally, I urge you to establish rigorous assessment protocols for microbes used in fermentation processes to ensure they are not genetically engineered (GE). Such verification is essential to maintaining the foundational principles of organic production and addressing emerging concerns about contamination pathways in organic systems.<br/><br/>Thank you for your attention to these critical issues that will serve to strengthen the organic standard.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Julie Morgan<br/>Kansas City, MO   \n",

This pesticide needs to be banned.  There is no way to regulate a chemical with such deleterious effects to run off contaminated water, fields that the run off or overspray hits, or compost that ends up in peoples gardens (both organic and non-organic) killing their food sources and potentially harming their health.  Composters fairly know if the manure they are recieving has been contaminated from livestock that have eaten grass or other vegetation that has been sprayed or contaminated.  The EPA and DOW should be held liable for all damages, but rarely do people ever know or are able to track it back to the source.  This is a intrusion on peoples rights.   Please ban this substance.     \n",

The Roadless Area Conservation Rule protects over 58 million acres of some of the wildest forests we have left, forests that protect critical wildlife habitat and drinking water for millions. Revoking the Roadless Rule puts landscapes, wildlife, and communities at risk. <br/><br/>Repealing this popular policy would devastate the wild places that bring us together and damage the fast-growing outdoor recreation industry that supports countless communities.

As an outdoors enthusiast, I cherish our country&#39;s public lands and waters, including the millions of acres of wild and roadless forests.<br/> <br/>Rescinding the Roadless Rule threatens landscapes that include some of the most iconic and well-loved places for climbing, fishing, hiking, backcountry skiing, mountain biking and paddling, as well as the economic value of recreation in many rural communities. Beyond these outdoor experiences, these protections are critically important in the face of a changing climate and changing demands on our public lands. These ecosystems help support all life on Earth, from clean drinking water to habitat for endangered wildlife.<br/> <br/>Please keep the Roadless Rule in place and help save these beloved forests. Millions of Americans have supported the Roadless Rule since its creation, and I join them in urging you to protect our legacy of public lands.   \n",

       "      <td>Comment from Vecchio, Deborah As one of 250,000 In Defense of Animals supporters and someone who cares deeply about wild animals, I urge you not to go through with this rule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Endangered Species Act is one of the world&amp;rsquo;s most powerful legal tools for protecting species from extinction and has an impressive success rate of 99%. If this rule goes through it would essentially gut the ESA and cause massive harm to the species it protects. Most certainly, species would go extinct because of this change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Often, endangered and threatened species are endangered or threatened because of a threat to their habitat. A species cannot survive without a home. Science shows that habitat loss is a leading cause of species extinction. When members of a species lose habitat, they lose shelter, breeding grounds, and access to food. To propose that the destruction of habitat does not harm a species goes against science and common sense. Because of this definition change, the crucial habitats that endangered animals need to survive could be opened up to logging, mining, development, and other activities that would threaten already endangered species. To save a species, the habitat the animal relies upon must be protected. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is important to keep the term &amp;ldquo;harm&amp;rdquo; defined as it is so that the ESA can continue to have a 99% success rate of saving species. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thank you for considering this comment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br/&gt;Mrs. Deborah Vecchio&lt;br/&gt;Gilbertsville, PA 19525-0684</td>\n",

The change would also hamper our ability to respond to climate change by preventing protection of areas that the best science has shown will soon become essential habitat due to changes in temperature and other key conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Habitat restoration has proved critical in helping many species come back from the brink, and managing for a changing climate is increasingly the only way we can save imperiled species.

When Congress passed the Endangered Species Act, it explicitly recognized the importance of habitat in protecting and restoring endangered species.

To propose that the destruction of habitat does not harm a species goes against science and common sense.

Habitat loss is a MAJOR driving factor of extinction. A majority of species protected by the Endangered Species Act are listed because of threats to their habitat. By removing the understood definition of &ldquo;harm,&rdquo; countless species will be pushed to the brink of extinction.<br/><br/>The Endangered Species Act is the most powerful tool we have to protect our wildlife and biodiversity &ndash; and this change would SEVERELY weaken it. I hope that you&rsquo;ll use your power to protect our vulnerable wildlife. <br/><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Nancy Fahey<br/>Salt Lake City, UT 84121<br/>nancyfahey92@gmail.com   \n",
       "3  Submitted Electronically via eRulemaking Portal In saving the Endangered Species Act, we save ourselves.<br/><br/>Despite the resounding success of the ESA, the proposed changes will make protecting endangered and threatened species more difficult. By defining habitat to exclude areas that currently cannot support a species, you would be foreclosing an important tool that has been used successfully in the past to promote species recovery. This change could preclude proactive and essential measures to establish an area as critical habitat and then restore that area for species recovery, a tactic thats been used from HawaiI to continental U.S. to help conserve the palila and other species trying to survive in degraded ecosystems. The change would also hamper our ability to respond to climate change by preventing protection of areas that the best science has shown will soon become essential habitat due to changes in temperature and other key conditions.<br/><br/>Habitat restoration has proved critical in helping many species come back from the brink, and managing for a changing climate is increasingly the only way we can save imperiled species. Limiting experts ability to make proactive decisions to conserve areas that will be important habitat in the future is shortsighted. This limiting definition is nothing more than a government handout for destructive industries that prefer to frack, drill, log, and otherwise exploit these lands.<br/><br/>This is why I urge you not to finalize this proposed rule. Global extinction rates are accelerating rapidly  a trend that the climate crisis will exacerbate  and we cant afford to undermine the already- limited capacity we have to respond. Please remove this rule change from consideration and continue doing the work that has already proven successful  our endangered species are counting on you to do the right thing.   \n",

Protecting and preserving critical habitat is essential for species survival. Habitats provide food, shelter, breeding grounds, and protection from predators. Their loss is a primary driver of species decline and extinction. <br/><br/>In 1995, the Supreme Court found the current definition appropriate under the ESA permitting system. The proposed changes to the ESA represent a serious threat to the future of wildlife conservation. <br/><br/>I urge you to maintain the current definition.   \n",

       "3  In saving the Endangered Species Act, we save ourselves.<br/><br/>Despite the resounding success of the ESA, the proposed changes will make protecting endangered and threatened species more difficult. By defining habitat to exclude areas that currently cannot support a species, you would be foreclosing an important tool that has been used successfully in the past to promote species recovery. This change could preclude proactive and essential measures to establish an area as critical habitat and then restore that area for species recovery, a tactic thats been used from HawaiI to continental U.S. to help conserve the palila and other species trying to survive in degraded ecosystems. The change would also hamper our ability to respond to climate change by preventing protection of areas that the best science has shown will soon become essential habitat due to changes in temperature and other key conditions.<br/><br/>Habitat restoration has proved critical in helping many species come back from the brink, and managing for a changing climate is increasingly the only way we can save imperiled species. Limiting experts ability to make proactive decisions to conserve areas that will be important habitat in the future is shortsighted. This limiting definition is nothing more than a government handout for destructive industries that prefer to frack, drill, log, and otherwise exploit these lands.<br/><br/>This is why I urge you not to finalize this proposed rule. Global extinction rates are accelerating rapidly  a trend that the climate crisis will exacerbate  and we cant afford to undermine the already- limited capacity we have to respond. Please remove this rule change from consideration and continue doing the work that has already proven successful  our endangered species are counting on you to do the right thing.   \n",

Protecting and preserving critical habitat is essential for species survival. Habitats provide food, shelter, breeding grounds, and protection from predators. Their loss is a primary driver of species decline and extinction. <br/><br/>In 1995, the Supreme Court found the current definition appropriate under the ESA permitting system. The proposed changes to the ESA represent a serious threat to the future of wildlife conservation. <br/><br/>I urge you to maintain the current definition.   \n",

When Congress passed the Endangered Species Act, it explicitly recognized the importance of habitat in protecting and restoring endangered species. And the definition of harm you seek to delete was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court 30 years ago.

This project therefore is not in the national interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I am deeply concerned about the number of both large and small&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;oil and gas spills in the Gulf of Mexico as a result of this project. It has been ten years since the Deepwater Horizon disaster that decimated our Gulf Coast - our marine ecosystems and coastal communities cant afford another disaster. The DEIS does not adequately analyze oil spill risks, especially potential impacts on the critically endangered Kemps Ridley Sea Turtle. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I am also concerned about impacts from air pollution emissions associated with this project. Local residents cannot afford the additional pollution burdens, as the region is already classified as nonattainment for EPAs health-based air quality standards for ozone, and NOx emissions would also exceed the threshold for concern. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I am also alarmed that the EIS does not consider the very real and foreseeable direct and indirect impacts of the projects greenhouse gas emissions on climate change. It is widely understood that crude exports are driving the rapid increase of oil and gas drilling in the Permian Basin - oil that could otherwise be left in the ground. MARAD must analyze the full lifecycle climate impacts of oil drilling, transportation, refining, and consumption that would result from this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, I am concerned that the EIS does not consider environmental justice impacts. Toxic pollution from existing oil and gas infrastructure disproportionately burdens low-income, minority communities in the Gulf of Mexico region. And, these communities are at ground zero for the impacts of climate change, including sea level rise, increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, and loss of critically protective wetlands. The Texas coastline is eroding at an average rate of 2 to 10 feet per year, and Freeport is experiencing sea level rise at a rate of 17 inches per 100 years. It is in this context, that MARAD must evaluate the environmental justice impacts of the proposed SPOT project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given all of these impacts and inadequacies, I urge MARAD to deny the Deepwater Port License Application for the Sea Port Oil Terminal.

In light of the current domestic and international political climate, we urge BOEM and President Biden not to bow to pressure from those who prioritize profit over people and end new oil and gas leasing in federal waters. A new report put out by Apogee Economics and Policy finds that no new leases in the Gulf of Mexico in the five-year program would result in a less than one-cent increase in gas prices over the next two decades. The citizens of the Gulf Coast will not be sacrificed in favor of industry profiteering any longer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are not alone in this. According to a Pew Research study from January of this year, 69% of Americans support a transition to renewable energy. You have the power and the responsibility to move this nation forward to a clean, safe, and prosperous energy-independent future, one not reliant on polluting fossil fuels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New lease sales in federal waters will cost us, and they will cost us dearly. The BP oil spill in 2010 cost American taxpayers an estimated $10 billion and caused the citizens of the Gulf Coast incalculable financial and personal loss. The Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska cost an estimated $7 billion, only a fraction of which was covered by Exxon. These are only two spills out of thousands, only $17 billion wasted out of an estimated $720 billion. We must not repeat the mistakes of the past. Every oil spill disaster began with a lease sale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to Oceana, a policy to protect all unleased federal waters from offshore drilling in the United States could prevent over 19 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions as well as more than $720 billion in damages to people, property, and the environment. The climate crisis is here and we cannot afford more drilling and its associated climate pollution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We implore you to take this opportunity to establish the path forward. We ask that the 2023-2028 National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program be amended to include zero new leases.</td>\n",

According to a Pew Research study from January of this year, 69% of Americans support a transition to renewable energy. You have the power and the responsibility to move this nation forward to a clean, safe, and prosperous energy-independent future, one not reliant on polluting fossil fuels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New lease sales in federal waters will cost us, and they will cost us dearly. The BP oil spill in 2010 cost American taxpayers an estimated $10 billion and caused the citizens of the Gulf Coast incalculable financial and personal loss. The Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska cost an estimated $7 billion, only a fraction of which was covered by Exxon. These are only two spills out of thousands, only $17 billion wasted out of an estimated $720 billion. We must not repeat the mistakes of the past. Every oil spill disaster began with a lease sale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to Oceana, a policy to protect all unleased federal waters from offshore drilling in the United States could prevent over 19 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions as well as more than $720 billion in damages to people, property, and the environment. The climate crisis is here and we cannot afford more drilling and its associated climate pollution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We implore you to take this opportunity to establish the path forward. We ask that the 2023-2028 National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program be amended to include zero new leases.</td>\n",

I&rsquo;m distressed to see that the Interior Department has plans to hold up to 11 new lease sales: 10 in the Gulf of Mexico and one in Alaska&rsquo;s Cook Inlet. <br/><br/>It is more crucial than ever that the Biden administration uses the full power of the Executive branch, including your agency, to help avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis.<br/><br/>New federal fossil fuel leasing is incompatible with President Biden&rsquo;s own climate and environmental justice commitments. We cannot meet our climate goals and open new fossil fuel extraction projects at the same time. If we wish to preserve a safe and livable climate for our families and communities, President Biden&rsquo;s Interior Department must swiftly bring an end to new federal offshore leasing.<br/><br/>Additionally, offshore drilling poses huge risks to the health of communities, workers, and wildlife, particularly in frontline and coastal communities who already bear the brunt of the climate crisis. This administration must swiftly usher a just transition to a clean energy future, not new federal fossil fuel leasing. <br/><br/>I sincerely urge you to recognize the harm that new federal leases pose, and follow through on your agency&rsquo;s own climate and environmental justice commitments. The time is now to use the powers of the executive branch to tackle the climate crisis, and offer no new leases in BOEM&rsquo;s final five-year program to protect our communities and our future.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time and attention to this important matter.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Johanna Fritzke<br/>Stacy, MN 55079   \n",

Climate experts say that we must reduce our carbon emissions dramatically to avoid the worst ravages of the climate crisis. The Federal Government has a unique ability to create market standards through its procurement process. It has a responsibility to make those standards as strong as possible. By making sure that federal purchasing dollars go to greener buildings and materials, lower- and zero-emission vehicles, and other more sustainable purchases, President Biden and his administration can provide a needed boost in the transition to a clean energy economy and incentivize the private sector to move in a more sustainable direction.<br/><br/>The 2018 National Climate Assessment found that the climate crisis could slash about a tenth of our economy by the end of the century.

As we transition to a clean energy economy, we have the opportunity to do what the fossil fuel industry never did &mdash; to set out from the beginning to better protect the communities and environments impacted by energy development. <br/><br/>The current policies we have in place are not sufficient to ensure a sustainable supply chain that protects communities from the impacts of mining and extraction of critical and other minerals. <br/><br/>That is why we welcome your administration&rsquo;s commitments to update mining regulations, and we are pushing for truly sustainable solutions to meet the demands of our country&rsquo;s clean energy transition. <br/><br/>We cannot justly move to a clean energy future at the cost of harming people or the environment.  <br/><br/>We urge your administration to protect communities that could be harmed by critical mineral mining and development by providing environmental, health, and cultural resource protections in BLM, USFS, and EPA regulations.  <br/><br/>There must be meaningful tribal consultation and community engagement with local stakeholders in communities impacted by potential critical mineral extraction, including the ability for mining impacted communities to say no to a proposed mine.  <br/><br/>We need to explore alternatives to mining such as incentivizing and strengthening the circular economy to reuse and recycle existing materials. The regulatory updates must also include financial assurance for mines, and closing the Clean Water Act loopholes that exist for mining.  <br/><br/>We need to ensure taxpayers are fairly compensated for mining on public lands while ending sweetheart deals and subsidies for mining companies and their lobbyists.  <br/><br/>In addition to improving these regulations, we urge your administration to work with Congress on reforming the 1872 Hardrock Mining Law to update it to confront the modern challenges of mining. <br/><br/>We do not need more dirty mining to achieve the clean energy transition, and greater accountability will ensure that any mining done in the United States will meet the highest environmental standards with minimal human impacts.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Carolyn Ludwig<br/>Royal Oak, MI 48067   \n",

       "7  Comment from Lilly Smith I am writing to express opposition to SPOT Terminal Services LLCs application for a Deepwater Port License from the Maritime Administration, docket number MARAD-2019-0011, and raise concerns with significant inadequacies in the projects environmental review (DEIS).<br/><br/>First and foremost, I am concerned that construction and operation of the export facility would only benefit oil and gas industry interests while placing massive burdens on local communities, the Gulf of Mexicos coastal and marine ecosystems, and the global climate. This project therefore is not in the national interest.<br/><br/>I am deeply concerned about the number of both large and small<br/><br/>oil and gas spills in the Gulf of Mexico as a result of this project. It has been ten years since the Deepwater Horizon disaster that decimated our Gulf Coast - our marine ecosystems and coastal communities cant afford another disaster. The DEIS does not adequately analyze oil spill risks, especially potential impacts on the critically endangered Kemps Ridley Sea Turtle. <br/><br/>I am also concerned about impacts from air pollution emissions associated with this project. Local residents cannot afford the additional pollution burdens, as the region is already classified as nonattainment for EPAs health-based air quality standards for ozone, and NOx emissions would also exceed the threshold for concern. <br/><br/>I am also alarmed that the EIS does not consider the very real and foreseeable direct and indirect impacts of the projects greenhouse gas emissions on climate change. It is widely understood that crude exports are driving the rapid increase of oil and gas drilling in the Permian Basin - oil that could otherwise be left in the ground. MARAD must analyze the full lifecycle climate impacts of oil drilling, transportation, refining, and consumption that would result from this project.<br/><br/>Finally, I am concerned that the EIS does not consider environmental justice impacts. Toxic pollution from existing oil and gas infrastructure disproportionately burdens low-income, minority communities in the Gulf of Mexico region. And, these communities are at ground zero for the impacts of climate change, including sea level rise, increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, and loss of critically protective wetlands. The Texas coastline is eroding at an average rate of 2 to 10 feet per year, and Freeport is experiencing sea level rise at a rate of 17 inches per 100 years. It is in this context, that MARAD must evaluate the environmental justice impacts of the proposed SPOT project.<br/><br/>Given all of these impacts and inadequacies, I urge MARAD to deny the Deepwater Port License Application for the Sea Port Oil Terminal. The project is not in the national interest and imposes too many risks and burdens on our Gulf Coast communities and ecosystems.   \n",

Keane Federal Register CAF&fnof; Standards Comments,<br/><br/>Pollution, especially from transportation, is not shared equally. Low-income communities of color are hit hardest, exposing them to harmful traffic-related air pollutants, such as particulate matter, which have been linked to various negative health impacts. Enhanced CAFE standards could not only boost fuel efficiency and save drivers money at the pump, but also decrease incidences of related respiratory illnesses, emergency room visits, lost-workdays, and premature death.  <br/><br/>    These are all good reasons to support stronger standards for climate change.  I value the lives of people who continue to be victims of the current harsh weather.  Please try to better our climate for everyone and save the planet for our children and grandchildren lives.

In light of the current domestic and international political climate, we urge BOEM and President Biden not to bow to pressure from those who prioritize profit over people and end new oil and gas leasing in federal waters. A new report put out by Apogee Economics and Policy finds that no new leases in the Gulf of Mexico in the five-year program would result in a less than one-cent increase in gas prices over the next two decades. The citizens of the Gulf Coast will not be sacrificed in favor of industry profiteering any longer.<br/><br/>We are not alone in this. According to a Pew Research study from January of this year, 69% of Americans support a transition to renewable energy. You have the power and the responsibility to move this nation forward to a clean, safe, and prosperous energy-independent future, one not reliant on polluting fossil fuels.<br/><br/>New lease sales in federal waters will cost us, and they will cost us dearly. The BP oil spill in 2010 cost American taxpayers an estimated $10 billion and caused the citizens of the Gulf Coast incalculable financial and personal loss. The Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska cost an estimated $7 billion, only a fraction of which was covered by Exxon. These are only two spills out of thousands, only $17 billion wasted out of an estimated $720 billion. We must not repeat the mistakes of the past. Every oil spill disaster began with a lease sale.<br/><br/>According to Oceana, a policy to protect all unleased federal waters from offshore drilling in the United States could prevent over 19 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions as well as more than $720 billion in damages to people, property, and the environment. The climate crisis is here and we cannot afford more drilling and its associated climate pollution. <br/><br/>We implore you to take this opportunity to establish the path forward. We ask that the 2023-2028 National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program be amended to include zero new leases.   \n",

I&rsquo;m distressed to see that the Interior Department has plans to hold up to 11 new lease sales: 10 in the Gulf of Mexico and one in Alaska&rsquo;s Cook Inlet. <br/><br/>It is more crucial than ever that the Biden administration uses the full power of the Executive branch, including your agency, to help avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis.<br/><br/>New federal fossil fuel leasing is incompatible with President Biden&rsquo;s own climate and environmental justice commitments. We cannot meet our climate goals and open new fossil fuel extraction projects at the same time. If we wish to preserve a safe and livable climate for our families and communities, President Biden&rsquo;s Interior Department must swiftly bring an end to new federal offshore leasing.<br/><br/>Additionally, offshore drilling poses huge risks to the health of communities, workers, and wildlife, particularly in frontline and coastal communities who already bear the brunt of the climate crisis. This administration must swiftly usher a just transition to a clean energy future, not new federal fossil fuel leasing. <br/><br/>I sincerely urge you to recognize the harm that new federal leases pose, and follow through on your agency&rsquo;s own climate and environmental justice commitments. The time is now to use the powers of the executive branch to tackle the climate crisis, and offer no new leases in BOEM&rsquo;s final five-year program to protect our communities and our future.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time and attention to this important matter.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Johanna Fritzke<br/>Stacy, MN 55079   \n",

As we transition to a clean energy economy, we have the opportunity to do what the fossil fuel industry never did &mdash; to set out from the beginning to better protect the communities and environments impacted by energy development. <br/><br/>The current policies we have in place are not sufficient to ensure a sustainable supply chain that protects communities from the impacts of mining and extraction of critical and other minerals. <br/><br/>That is why we welcome your administration&rsquo;s commitments to update mining regulations, and we are pushing for truly sustainable solutions to meet the demands of our country&rsquo;s clean energy transition. <br/><br/>We cannot justly move to a clean energy future at the cost of harming people or the environment.  <br/><br/>We urge your administration to protect communities that could be harmed by critical mineral mining and development by providing environmental, health, and cultural resource protections in BLM, USFS, and EPA regulations.  <br/><br/>There must be meaningful tribal consultation and community engagement with local stakeholders in communities impacted by potential critical mineral extraction, including the ability for mining impacted communities to say no to a proposed mine.  <br/><br/>We need to explore alternatives to mining such as incentivizing and strengthening the circular economy to reuse and recycle existing materials. The regulatory updates must also include financial assurance for mines, and closing the Clean Water Act loopholes that exist for mining.  <br/><br/>We need to ensure taxpayers are fairly compensated for mining on public lands while ending sweetheart deals and subsidies for mining companies and their lobbyists.  <br/><br/>In addition to improving these regulations, we urge your administration to work with Congress on reforming the 1872 Hardrock Mining Law to update it to confront the modern challenges of mining. <br/><br/>We do not need more dirty mining to achieve the clean energy transition, and greater accountability will ensure that any mining done in the United States will meet the highest environmental standards with minimal human impacts.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Carolyn Ludwig<br/>Royal Oak, MI 48067   \n",

       "7  I am writing to express opposition to SPOT Terminal Services LLCs application for a Deepwater Port License from the Maritime Administration, docket number MARAD-2019-0011, and raise concerns with significant inadequacies in the projects environmental review (DEIS).<br/><br/>First and foremost, I am concerned that construction and operation of the export facility would only benefit oil and gas industry interests while placing massive burdens on local communities, the Gulf of Mexicos coastal and marine ecosystems, and the global climate. This project therefore is not in the national interest.<br/><br/>I am deeply concerned about the number of both large and small<br/><br/>oil and gas spills in the Gulf of Mexico as a result of this project. It has been ten years since the Deepwater Horizon disaster that decimated our Gulf Coast - our marine ecosystems and coastal communities cant afford another disaster. The DEIS does not adequately analyze oil spill risks, especially potential impacts on the critically endangered Kemps Ridley Sea Turtle. <br/><br/>I am also concerned about impacts from air pollution emissions associated with this project. Local residents cannot afford the additional pollution burdens, as the region is already classified as nonattainment for EPAs health-based air quality standards for ozone, and NOx emissions would also exceed the threshold for concern. <br/><br/>I am also alarmed that the EIS does not consider the very real and foreseeable direct and indirect impacts of the projects greenhouse gas emissions on climate change. It is widely understood that crude exports are driving the rapid increase of oil and gas drilling in the Permian Basin - oil that could otherwise be left in the ground. MARAD must analyze the full lifecycle climate impacts of oil drilling, transportation, refining, and consumption that would result from this project.<br/><br/>Finally, I am concerned that the EIS does not consider environmental justice impacts. Toxic pollution from existing oil and gas infrastructure disproportionately burdens low-income, minority communities in the Gulf of Mexico region. And, these communities are at ground zero for the impacts of climate change, including sea level rise, increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, and loss of critically protective wetlands. The Texas coastline is eroding at an average rate of 2 to 10 feet per year, and Freeport is experiencing sea level rise at a rate of 17 inches per 100 years. It is in this context, that MARAD must evaluate the environmental justice impacts of the proposed SPOT project.<br/><br/>Given all of these impacts and inadequacies, I urge MARAD to deny the Deepwater Port License Application for the Sea Port Oil Terminal. The project is not in the national interest and imposes too many risks and burdens on our Gulf Coast communities and ecosystems.   \n",

Low-income communities of color are hit hardest, exposing them to harmful traffic-related air pollutants, such as particulate matter, which have been linked to various negative health impacts. Enhanced CAFE standards could not only boost fuel efficiency and save drivers money at the pump, but also decrease incidences of related respiratory illnesses, emergency room visits, lost-workdays, and premature death.  <br/><br/>    These are all good reasons to support stronger standards for climate change.  I value the lives of people who continue to be victims of the current harsh weather.  Please try to better our climate for everyone and save the planet for our children and grandchildren lives.

In light of the current domestic and international political climate, we urge BOEM and President Biden not to bow to pressure from those who prioritize profit over people and end new oil and gas leasing in federal waters. A new report put out by Apogee Economics and Policy finds that no new leases in the Gulf of Mexico in the five-year program would result in a less than one-cent increase in gas prices over the next two decades. The citizens of the Gulf Coast will not be sacrificed in favor of industry profiteering any longer.<br/><br/>We are not alone in this. According to a Pew Research study from January of this year, 69% of Americans support a transition to renewable energy. You have the power and the responsibility to move this nation forward to a clean, safe, and prosperous energy-independent future, one not reliant on polluting fossil fuels.<br/><br/>New lease sales in federal waters will cost us, and they will cost us dearly. The BP oil spill in 2010 cost American taxpayers an estimated $10 billion and caused the citizens of the Gulf Coast incalculable financial and personal loss. The Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska cost an estimated $7 billion, only a fraction of which was covered by Exxon. These are only two spills out of thousands, only $17 billion wasted out of an estimated $720 billion. We must not repeat the mistakes of the past. Every oil spill disaster began with a lease sale.<br/><br/>According to Oceana, a policy to protect all unleased federal waters from offshore drilling in the United States could prevent over 19 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions as well as more than $720 billion in damages to people, property, and the environment. The climate crisis is here and we cannot afford more drilling and its associated climate pollution. <br/><br/>We implore you to take this opportunity to establish the path forward. We ask that the 2023-2028 National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program be amended to include zero new leases.   \n",
